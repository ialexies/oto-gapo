## Comparison: Codemagic vs GitHub Actions

| Feature                  | Codemagic         | GitHub Actions                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Setup Complexity**     | GUI + Simple YAML | Manual YAML + Secrets + Fastlane |
| **Play Store Upload**    | Built-in          | Requires Fastlane                |
| **Keystore Management**  | Upload in UI      | Base64 + Secrets                 |
| **iOS Builds**           | Mac M1 included   | Need Mac or paid runner          |
| **Build Speed**          | 10-15 min         | 15-20 min                        |
| **Free Tier**            | 500 min/month     | 2,000 min/month (private)        |
| **After Free Tier**      | $0.095/min        | $0.008/min                       |
| **Team Plan**            | $99/month         | Included in GitHub               |
| **Learning Curve**       | Low (GUI-based)   | Medium (YAML-heavy)              |
| **Flutter Optimization** | Yes               | No                               |

## Usage Examples

### Standard Release with Codemagic

```bash
# 1. Bump version
./scripts/bump_version.sh minor

# 2. Commit changes
git commit -am "chore: bump version to 1.1.0"
git push origin main

# 3. Create and push tag
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0

# 4. Codemagic automatically:
#    - Builds Android AAB and APK
#    - Uploads to Play Store (internal track, 10% rollout)
#    - Builds web application
#    - Sends email notification
```

### Manual Test Build

1. Go to Codemagic dashboard
2. Click "Start new build"
3. Select workflow: `manual-build`
4. Optionally edit `BUILD_FLAVOR` and `BUILD_TARGET`
5. Click "Start new build"
6. Download artifacts when complete

### Firebase Auto-Deployment

```bash
# Simply push to main
git checkout main
git commit -am "feat: update web UI"
git push origin main

# Codemagic automatically:
# - Builds web app
# - Deploys to Firebase Hosting
```

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Production Testing

- [x] Configuration file created (`codemagic.yaml`)
- [x] Documentation written
- [x] `.gitignore` updated
- [ ] Codemagic account created
- [ ] Repository connected to Codemagic
- [ ] Keystore uploaded
- [ ] Google Play credentials configured
- [ ] Test CI build
- [ ] Test manual build
- [ ] Test production release (test tag)

### Recommended Testing Sequence

1. **Test CI workflow** - Push a commit to a feature branch
2. **Test manual build** - Trigger via Codemagic UI
3. **Test production release** - Create test tag `v1.0.1-codemagic-test`
4. **Verify Play Store upload** - Check internal track in Play Console
5. **Clean up test artifacts** - Delete test tag after verification

---

## Migration Strategy

### Recommended Approach: Parallel Running

**Week 1:** Set up Codemagic, configure credentials, test CI builds  
**Week 2-3:** Run both platforms in parallel, compare results  
**Week 4:** Use Codemagic for releases, keep GitHub Actions for CI  
**Week 5+:** Decide on full migration or keep both

### Benefits of Parallel Running

âœ… Zero disruption to existing workflow  
âœ… Time to evaluate Codemagic thoroughly  
âœ… Fallback option if issues arise  
âœ… Team can learn new platform gradually

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise with Codemagic:

**Option 1:** Re-enable GitHub Actions release workflow

```bash
mv .github/workflows/release.yml.disabled .github/workflows/release.yml
git commit -am "rollback: re-enable GitHub Actions"
git push
```

**Option 2:** Use GitHub Actions for one release (if workflows still active)

**Option 3:** Manual build and upload to Play Console

## Cost Analysis

### Typical Monthly Usage

| Activity       | Minutes | Frequency  | Monthly Total |
| -------------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| CI builds      | 10 min  | 20 pushes  | 200 min       |
| Release builds | 15 min  | 2 releases | 30 min        |
| Manual builds  | 12 min  | 5 tests    | 60 min        |
| **Total**      |         |            | **~290 min**  |

### Cost Comparison

**Codemagic:**

- Free tier: 500 min/month âœ… **Sufficient for typical usage**
- After free tier: $0.095/min (~$5.70/hour)
- Team plan: $99/month (unlimited)

**GitHub Actions:**

- Free tier: 2,000 min/month (private repos)
- After free tier: $0.008/min (~$0.48/hour)

**Verdict:** For typical usage (~290 min/month), **both platforms are free**. ðŸŽ‰
