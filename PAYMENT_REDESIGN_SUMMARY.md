## Key Improvements

### âœ¨ Before vs After

| Aspect          | Old System (monthly_dues)    | New System (payment_transactions) |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Status          | Inferred from payment_date   | Explicit status field             |
| Duplicates      | Frequent issues              | Prevented by unique constraint    |
| Payment Methods | Not tracked                  | Cash/Bank/GCash/Other             |
| Audit Trail     | None                         | recorded_by + timestamps          |
| Caching         | Complex workarounds          | Not needed                        |
| UI Complexity   | Debug buttons, cleanup tools | Clean, simple interface           |
| Data Quality    | Inconsistent                 | Reliable and clean                |
