# 16 KB Page Size Support - Quick Start Guide

## What You Need to Know

**Google Play now requires all apps targeting Android 15+ to support 16 KB memory page sizes.**

**Deadline**: November 1, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… Your app is already configured!

## Quick Verification (2 minutes)

### 1. Build Your App Bundle

```bash
flutter build appbundle --release --target lib/main_production.dart --flavor production
```

### 2. Upload to Play Console

- Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
- Upload your AAB to any track (internal recommended for testing)
- Look for "16 KB support" âœ… indicator

### 3. Done!

If Play Console shows 16 KB support, you're all set!

## What Was Changed

Your app already has the necessary configuration:

**`android/gradle.properties`**:

```properties
android.bundle.enableUncompressedNativeLibs=false
```

**`android/app/build.gradle.kts`**:

```kotlin
packagingOptions {
    jniLibs {
        useLegacyPackaging = false
    }
}
```

## Testing (Optional but Recommended)

### Quick Test on Emulator

1. **Create 16 KB emulator**:

   ```bash
   avdmanager create avd -n "Test_16KB" \
     -k "system-images;android-35;google_apis;x86_64" \
     -d "pixel_8"
   ```

2. **Launch with 16 KB pages**:

   ```bash
   emulator -avd Test_16KB -qemu -machine kernel-page-size=16k
   ```

3. **Run your app**:

   ```bash
   flutter run --release --target lib/main_production.dart --flavor production
   ```

4. **Verify**:
   - App launches âœ“
   - All features work âœ“
   - No crashes âœ“

## Troubleshooting

### App crashes on 16 KB emulator?

```bash
# Update Flutter and dependencies

# Clean rebuild
flutter clean
flutter build appbundle --release --target lib/main_production.dart --flavor production
```
