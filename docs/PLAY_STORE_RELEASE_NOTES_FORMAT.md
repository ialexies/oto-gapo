# Google Play Store Release Notes Format Guide

This guide explains the correct format for release notes in Google Play Console.

---

## ‚ùå INCORRECT Format (This is NOT used)

```xml
<en-GB>
Enter or paste your release notes for en-GB here
</en-GB>
```

**This XML format is NOT used by Google Play or Fastlane!**

---

### Method 2: Fastlane Automated Upload

For automated uploads with Fastlane, release notes are stored as **plain text files** in this structure:

```
android/fastlane/metadata/android/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en-US/                          # English (United States)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ changelogs/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.txt                   # Release notes for version code 1
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2.txt                   # Release notes for version code 2
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 3.txt                   # Release notes for version code 3
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ full_description.txt        # Store listing description
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ short_description.txt       # Short description (80 chars)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ title.txt                   # App title
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ video.txt                   # (optional) YouTube video URL
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fil-PH/                         # Filipino (Philippines)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ changelogs/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.txt
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ title.txt
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ short_description.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other-language-codes]/         # Add more languages as needed
```

#### Key Points:

1. **No XML tags** - just plain text files
2. **File naming**: `{version_code}.txt` (e.g., `1.txt`, `2.txt`, `3.txt`)
3. **Language codes**: Use ISO 639-1 codes (e.g., `en-US`, `fil-PH`, `es-ES`)
4. **Version code**: Must match the `versionCode` in your app

## How to Add More Languages

2. Select language from dropdown
3. Paste translated release notes
4. Repeat for each language

### Via Fastlane:

1. Create new language folder:

   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "android\fastlane\metadata\android\[LANGUAGE-CODE]\changelogs"
   ```

2. Create changelog file:

   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType File -Path "android\fastlane\metadata\android\[LANGUAGE-CODE]\changelogs\1.txt"
   ```

3. Add your translated content to the file

4. Fastlane will automatically upload all language versions

---

## Uploading with Fastlane

Once your metadata files are ready:

```bash
cd android
bundle exec fastlane internal   # For internal testing
bundle exec fastlane alpha      # For alpha track
bundle exec fastlane beta       # For beta track
bundle exec fastlane production # For production
```

Fastlane will automatically:

- Upload the AAB file
- Upload release notes from `changelogs/{version_code}.txt`
- Upload store listing metadata if not skipped

---

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it concise**: Stay under 500 characters
2. **Highlight key features**: Focus on what's new or important
3. **Use emojis sparingly**: They work well but don't overuse
4. **Be clear**: Avoid jargon and technical terms
5. **Localize properly**: Don't just machine-translate, use native speakers
6. **Update for each release**: Explain what changed
7. **Test the format**: Preview in Play Console before publishing

## Troubleshooting

**Q: My release notes are too long**

- A: Keep under 500 characters. Focus on top 3-5 features.

**Q: Emojis don't display correctly**

- A: Use standard Unicode emojis. Test in Play Console preview.

**Q: Fastlane doesn't upload my changelog**

- A: Ensure filename matches version code exactly (e.g., `1.txt` for versionCode 1)

**Q: Can I use HTML or Markdown?**

- A: No, only plain text. Bullets (‚Ä¢) and line breaks are supported.

**Q: Do I need all languages?**

- A: No, English (en-US) is sufficient to start. Add more as needed.
