   - Select "Deploy Web" workflow
   - Choose: environment=staging, hosting=artifacts-only
   - Run workflow and download artifacts

3. **Test Release Workflow** (create test tag)
   ```bash
   git tag v0.0.1-test
   git push origin v0.0.1-test
   # Watch for release creation with all artifacts
   # Delete test release and tag after verification
   ```

## Conclusion

✅ **Both Android and Web CI/CD pipelines are fully configured and verified.**

The Oto Gapo application now has:

- ✅ Automated building for Android and Web
- ✅ Continuous integration testing on every push
- ✅ Automated releases with multi-platform artifacts
- ✅ Flexible deployment options for web (Firebase, GitHub Pages, manual)
