## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (>=3.3.0)
- Dart SDK (>=3.3.0)
- Firebase project setup
- PocketBase instance

### Setup Process

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
3. Generate code: `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
4. Configure Firebase and PocketBase
5. Run the app: `flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart`

### Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate code
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Run tests
flutter test --coverage

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Auto-fix lints and format (recommended before every commit)
./scripts/fix_lints.sh   # macOS/Linux
# or
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/fix_lints.ps1  # Windows

# Build for different platforms
flutter build apk --flavor production
flutter build ios --flavor production
flutter build web --flavor production
```
