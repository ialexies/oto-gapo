## Dart Style

- **Analysis**: Uses `very_good_analysis` and `flutter_lints`.
- **Naming**:
  - Prefer descriptive names (avoid 1â€“2 letter identifiers).
  - Functions as verbs; classes and variables as nouns.
- **Types**:
  - Annotate public APIs and exports explicitly; avoid `dynamic`/`any`-like patterns.
- **Control flow**:
  - Use guard clauses and early returns; avoid deep nesting.
  - Handle errors meaningfully; do not swallow exceptions.
- **Formatting**:
  - Match existing style; keep lines readable and avoid dense one-liners.
- **Comments**:
  - Explain "why" for complex code; avoid trivial comments.

Project specifics:

- Keep bloc logic side-effect free; put IO in repositories.
- Use `context.read<T>()`/`context.watch<T>()` appropriately in widgets.
- Keep theming via `ThemeProvider` and avoid instantiating `ThemeData` inline.
