## Assets and ScreenUtil

- **Assets**:

  - Declared in `pubspec.yaml` under `flutter.assets`: `assets/`, `assets/images/`, `assets/icons/`.
  - Reference with `Image.asset('assets/images/your.png')` or similar APIs.
  - Keep filenames lowercase with underscores; update `pubspec.yaml` when adding folders.

- **ScreenUtil**:
  - Initialize via `ScreenUtilInit` in `AppView` with `designSize: Size(375, 812)`.
  - Use `xx.sp` for font sizes, `xx.w`/`xx.h`/`xx.r` for sizes/radius. Example: `16.sp`, `24.w`.
  - Ensure `await ScreenUtil.ensureScreenSize()` is called in `main_*` before building.

Guidelines:

- Prefer vector or high-resolution raster images and cache where appropriate.
- Keep UI spacing consistent by standardizing on `ScreenUtil` helpers across pages.
