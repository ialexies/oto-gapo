## Workspace Conventions

- **Code generation**:

  - Routes (auto_route):
    ```bash
    dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```

- **Run flavors**:

  - DEV:
    ```bash
    flutter run -t lib/main_development.dart
    ```
  - STAGING:
    ```bash
    flutter run -t lib/main_staging.dart
    ```
  - PROD:
    ```bash
    flutter run -t lib/main_production.dart
    ```

- **Android signing and Firebase**:

  - Ensure `android/app/google-services.json` is present for DEV/PROD as appropriate.
  - iOS uses `Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` (not shown here).

- **Testing**:
  ```bash
  flutter test
  ```

Notes:

- After adding assets, `flutter pub get` and hot-restart.
- Keep `pubspec.yaml` versions aligned across packages.
