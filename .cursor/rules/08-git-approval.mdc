description: Require explicit approval for any git commit/push operations
---

## Git Operation Policy

- Do not perform `git commit`, `git push`, `git tag`, or branch deletion automatically.
- All git operations must be explicitly requested by the user and confirmed per action.
- When proposing git actions, show the exact command and wait for user approval before executing.
- Prefer staging changes and showing a summary (`git status`, `git diff --name-only`) before any commit.
